#F 3.0 - Operate SCCS Context
#####################################################################################
Initialize the SCCS: (F 3.1)
	Import (third-party) Julia packages

	Establish connection with microphone array (F 3.1.1 - Connect to mic array)

	Perform initial I/O user interaction procedure:
		Display Welcome message
		Inform user of all functionalities and controls
		Obtain user settings: (F 3.1.2)
			Login Details
			State & Mode of operation
			Train/re-train classifier?
			Perform Self Test?
			
	if alreadyTrained and not reTrain
		Load the (pre-trained) classifier (F 3.1.3)
	else
		train classifier (F 3.1.4) and keep user informed on progress

	if selfTest
		Perform self-test: (F 3.1.5)
			run classifier against the test set
			if selfTest_Fail
				inform user
				train again using the current (updated) training set
				test classifier again
				if selfTest_Fail again
					disable SCCS and contact the supervising engineer
			if selfTest_Pass
				inform user that the SCCS is in operational condition


if ActiveState
	Monitor area: (F 3.2)

		Detect sound (F 3.2.1)

		Record detected sound sample (F 3.2.2)

		Perform pre-processing on the recorded sound sample (F 3.2.3)

		Classify sound (F 3.2.4)

		Perform actions accordingly:
			Provide output (via User Interface)
			if reactiveMode
				contactAuthorities()

		Detect user input (F 3.2.6)
